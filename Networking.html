        <!-- Overview -->
        <article>
            <h2>What is Computer Networking?</h2>
            <p>Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. Networking allows devices to communicate with each other, share files, and access the internet. It involves hardware components like routers, switches, and cables, as well as software protocols that ensure data is transmitted correctly.</p>

        <!-- History -->
        <article>
            <h2>History of Computer Networking</h2>
            <h3>Early Days</h3>
            <p>The concept of computer networking began in the 1960s with the creation of ARPANET by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPANET was the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite, which became the foundation for the modern Internet.</p>
            <h3>1980s-1990s</h3>
            <p>During the 1980s and 1990s, the development of Ethernet technology by Robert Metcalfe revolutionized local area networks (LANs). The introduction of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 made the internet accessible to the general public, leading to a rapid expansion of networking technology.</p>
            <h3>2000s-Present</h3>
            <p>In the 2000s, the rise of wireless networking, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) transformed the networking landscape. Modern networks are faster, more reliable, and capable of handling vast amounts of data.</p>

        <!-- Key Concepts -->
        <article>
            <h2>Key Concepts in Computer Networking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protocols</strong>: Rules that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. Common protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Addressing</strong>: Assigning unique addresses to devices on a network to identify and communicate with each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Routing</strong>: The process of determining the best path for data to travel across a network.</li>
                <li><strong>Switching</strong>: The mechanism used to forward data packets between devices within the same network.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Topologies</strong>: The arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a computer network. Examples include star, ring, and mesh topologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireless Networking</strong>: Connecting devices without physical cables using technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Security</strong>: Measures taken to protect data during transmission and the network from unauthorized access and threats.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <!-- Types of Networks -->
        <article>
            <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong>: A network that spans a small geographic area, such as a single building or campus.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong>: A network that spans a large geographic area, often a country or continent. The internet is the largest WAN.</li>
                <li><strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</strong>: A network that spans a city or metropolitan area.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Area Network (PAN)</strong>: A network that connects devices within a person's workspace, such as a Bluetooth connection between a smartphone and a computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong>: A secure network that uses encryption and other security measures to connect remote users to a private network over the internet.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <!-- Network Devices -->
        <article>
            <h2>Key Network Devices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Router</strong>: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks, creating an internetwork.</li>
                <li><strong>Switch</strong>: A device that connects devices within a single network, forwarding data to its destination based on MAC addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Hub</strong>: A basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network. Unlike a switch, a hub broadcasts data to all devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Point</strong>: A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi or other wireless standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Modem</strong>: A device that modulates and demodulates signals for data transmission over telephone lines or cables.</li>
                <li><strong>Firewall</strong>: A security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
            </ul>
